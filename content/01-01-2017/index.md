<h2>Love Song by Four Year Strong</h2>
<p>
I'm almost certain that there will be a Four Year Strong song on every single list that I write for this blog. This cover is excellent- the original song was incredibly fit for a harder makeover, and Four Year Strong executed it flawlessly. The guitar is gorgeous, the singing is full of emotion, and I love it to death.

<h2>Kiss Me by New Found Glory</h2>
<p>
I'm sorry, but this song is undeniably adorable. The lyrics are just plain cute, and without New Found Glory playing it, it's way too sweet for me to be able to listen to it. Thankfully, New Found Glory turned up the rad factor, and made the song cool to listen to again. Thanks New Found Glory!

<h2>I Knew You Were Trouble by We Came As Romans</h2>
<p>
Let's just be honest with ourselves here, it's really hard to dislike Taylor Swift's music. The original version of this song is good to begin with, but We Came As Romans added that heavy guitar that I love, with some nasty vocals too. This is a song which constantly gets stuck in my head, and it has that "wow this is a hard version of a T Swift song" factor which makes me laugh most times that I listen. Fantastic.
