<h2>Pins and Needles by Transit </h2>
<p>
    Honestly, this song took a while to grow on me. My first listen I pretty much immediately skipped past it, not having a full appreciation for the unique vocals, and definitely not paying attention to the catchy beat. Also, I have to mention the the hook really isn't too impressive. That being said, it's definitely a song worth giving a shot. I can't really explain properly what makes this song so great, but it is just a pleasure to listen to, and I find myself bopping along to it often.

<h2>Jaded by With Confidence</h2>
<p>
    This is just one of those songs that I can't stop listening to. Everything about it is absolutely fantastic- the guitar is absolutely gnarly, Jayden Seeley's voice is awesome, and the lyrics are pretty great. I love this song, it's super catchy, and I think you should give it a listen.

<h2>Blame it on this Song by Chunk! No, Captain Chunk!</h2>
<p>
    This song rocks. The guitar is heavy, and totally kicks ass.

<h2>Who Cares? by Four Year Strong</h2>
<p>
    I love Four Year Strong, and you should too. They are one of the only bands that I can just sit down and listen to, and frankly I'm pretty convinced that they don't have a single bad song. This song is no exception, give it a try.

<h2>Icarus by With Confidence</h2>
<p>
    I'm a sucker for break-up songs, and this is one of the best I've heard. It's very raw, and also happens to be pretty catchy. Cannot recommend enough.

    Welp, there's your 5. What do you think? Are these super lame? Do you want to argue the genres as to which they belong? Do you hate that I only wrote like a sentence for each item?
