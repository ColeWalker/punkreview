Being an NJ native, I kind of had to feature an NJ local band first. To quote that guy from Jimmy Eat World, "nobody celebrates their hometown heroes quite like New Jersey". Senses Fail have this very raw, emotional sound, that's unique and hard to match. I'd put their lyricism just underneath Say Anything, which is saying a lot, because Say Anything is the top of my scale for lyrics. (The bottom is the Sunrise Skater Kids, but I'll save that for another post)

    Senses Fail really shine with their lyrics, they have a song which will touch everyone, in addition to just rocking. My personal favorite of theirs is Gold Jacket, Green Jacket, which is this great commentary on consumerism and politics in America, it's really powerful and just all around awesome.

    Is It Gonna Be The Year is another one of their songs that totally speaks to me. I love the slight hint of optimism throughout it, and the beat.

    Honestly, you can't really go wrong with Senses Fail. Give them a whirl, they're fantastic.
